            <p class="bold">I am interested in working as a Microsoft Access programmer in your esteemed organization</p>
            <p class="small">I can create simple but effective database management using MS Access
                Expert in the general use of Microsoft Access
                Improved database management skills
               In-depth knowledge of various data recovery procedures in case of data loss
                Good knowledge of the connection between Access and other software.
                Programming in C is like fast dancing on the freshly polished floor of people with sharp razors in their hands.
                Don't worry if something doesn't work. If everything worked, you'd be fired.
                For a long time it was a mystery to me how something very expensive and technologically advanced could be so useless. And soon I realized that a computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things,
                 whereas programmers are smart people who have the talent to do incredible stupid things. 
                In short, they found each other.Debugging code is twice as difficult as writing it. 
                So if you write code as smart as you can, then by definition you are not smart enough to debug it.

            <p class="bold">High income!</p>
            <p class="small">Of course, it's not all at once, but working in IT, 
                you just won't have a headache about how to provide your life with the necessary resources.
                The initial start in IT is individual. Someone is so brilliant that they can immediately claim a high position. 
                Someone will need 5-7 years of experience to take on more responsible responsibilities, more complex tasks. 
                And someone could be put in a managerial position after a year of work,
                 but only because it is on this project and with this team of people that a person can cope. Which doesn't mean it would be possible on another project. 
                It's the same with wages.In a good design, adding something costs less than the thing itself.
                Sometimes it's better to stay home to sleep on Monday than to spend the whole week debugging code written on Monday.
                Measuring a programmer's productivity by counting lines of code is the same as evaluating the construction of an airplane by its weight.</p>

             new experiences that help to see the world differently and understand it better.

            <p class="bold">The peculiarity of the sphere is that I can never consider myself a professional</p>
            <p class="small">Because in fact I am a professional only at the moment when I say it. And then op – and a new framework,
            tool or something else came out that you need to go to study and implement into your work faster.
            But it's also great– I'm always getting better.The initial start in IT is individual. Someone is so brilliant that they can immediately claim a high position.
