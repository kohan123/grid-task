            <p>High income</p>
            <p>Of course, it's not all at once, but working in IT, 
                you just won't have a headache about how to provide your life with the necessary resources.
                The initial start in IT is individual. Someone is so brilliant that they can immediately claim a high position. 
                Someone will need 5-7 years of experience to take on more responsible responsibilities, more complex tasks. 
                And someone could be put in a managerial position after a year of work,
                 but only because it is on this project and with this team of people that a person can cope. Which doesn't mean it would be possible on another project. 
                It's the same with wages.</p>

            <p>The peculiarity of the sphere is that I can never consider myself a professional</p>
            <p>Because in fact I am a professional only at the moment when I say it. And then op – and a new framework,
            tool or something else came out that you need to go to study and implement into your work faster.
            But it's also great– I'm always getting better.The initial start in IT is individual. Someone is so brilliant that they can immediately claim a high position.
